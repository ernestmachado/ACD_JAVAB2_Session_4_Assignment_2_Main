What is displayed when the following code is executed?
class Parent{
private void method1(){
System.out.println ("Parent's method1()");
}
public void method2() {
System.out.println ("Parent's method2()");
method1();
}
}
class Child extends Parent {
public void method1() {
System.out.println ("Child's method1()");
}
public static void main(String args[]) {
Parent p = new Child();
p.method2();
}}

The outcome must be one of the following:
A. Compile-time error
B. Run-time error
C. Prints : Parent's method2()
Parent's method1()
D. Prints : Parent's method2()
Child's method1()

ANSWER :
C. Prints : Parent's method2()
Parent's method1()

- The program will start with the main() method of the Child class in which we are calling the method1() of the Parent class.
- Once the method1() is executed it will print Parent's method2() and inturn call method2() of Parent class.
- Even though method2() is private it is accessable in the Parent chas and will print Parent's method1()
